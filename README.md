# DistoRt Homeserver
([site](https://ryco117.github.io/distort-server/))

### About
A reference implementation homeserver for the research anonymity protocol [DistoRt](https://distortapp.org) (designed by [JS Légaré](https://github.com/init-js)), with message broadcasting performed over [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). 
The homeserver is created with Node.js and stores its data to a MongoDB database. It can be interacted with remotely through REST API calls. 
A privately managed IPFS node must be exposed to the homeserver for pushing and receiving messages.

### Security
DistoRt provides both **anonymity** and **confidentiality**. This means that both the recipients and contents of messages are hidden from anyone monitoring the communication.
This is achieved through the use of public-key cryptography and a broadcast network. Messages are encrypted using the public key of the recipient and broadcast over the network to all participants.
Since the message was encrypted to a specific key, only intended target will be able to decrypt and read the contents. Furthermore, since the message was broadcast, any one of the peers on the channel
could potentially be the target of the message, providing receiver anonymity. In addition, messages are broadcast exactly once every `5 minutes` to ensure that anonymity can be preserved even when an attacker is 
listening for patterns in timing between outgoing messages.

### Build
##### Docker Build
Run `docker-compose up` to launch containers for a private MongoDB database, contained IPFS node, and the distort homeserver (exposing the configured port; default is 6945).

##### Host Build
Can be easily built with `make && npm install` then launched with `npm start`. In this instance you are responsible for having a private MongoDB database and IPFS node that the homeserver can access.
This will require manual configuration of the `config.json` file, documentation for which can be found [here](https://ryco117.github.io/distort-server/docs/#configuration).

### Technical Docs

### Additional Comments
* It is highly recommended to join anonymity group `パン` until there are enough large-scale anonymity groups that safe alternatives exist (which admittedly is a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg situation)
* While the REST API calls offer no end-to-end encryption of their own between the client and server, it is highly recommended to create a reverse proxy in front of the server, using HTTPS with a 
signed certificate. The certificates can be signed either by a recognized Certificate Authority (eg., [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) or be self-signed. If self-signing, ensure that the client trusts the certificate.
