        - Body parameters:
            - `message` set to the plaintext of the message to enqueue
            - `toPeerId` set to the IPFS node ID of the peer
            - (Optional) `toAccountName` set to the account name of the peer. Defaults to "root"
            - `toNickname` set to the friendly nickname set for the peer
            
            Note: peer specified by either `toNickname` or by `toPeerId` [ + `toAccountName`]

	* **DELETE** - Leave group
	    - Action: leaves the group `group-name`

	    - Return: an object containing two fields, `in` and `out`, each of which are arrays of message objects, all received and sent (respectively) messages (in the uniquely specified conversation), with indicies between `index-start` and `index-end` (inclusively)

	* **POST** - Add peer
	* **DELETE** - Remove peer
	
---
Note: Authenticated HTTP requests take headers: 
* `peerid` set to the IPFS node ID of the account to authorize as. Must be equal to the IPFS ID of the current node in use
* `authtoken` set to the Base64 encoded hash of the account's password. Hash algorithm is PBKDF2 using SHA-256. The salt is the IPFS node ID (equivalent to `peerid`), and the work-constant is `1000`
* (Optional) `accountname` set to the name of the account to authorize as. If field is not specified or empty, will default to `root`
