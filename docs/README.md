Note: Authenticated HTTP requests take headers: 
* `peerid` set to the IPFS node ID of the account to authorize as. Must be equal to the IPFS ID of the current node in use.
* `authtoken` set to the Base64 encoded hash of the account's password. Hash algorithm is PBKDF2 using SHA-256. The salt is the IPFS node ID (equivalent to `peerid`), and the work-constant is `1000`.
* (Optional) `accountname` set to the name of the account to authorize as. If field is not specified or empty, will default to `root`.
