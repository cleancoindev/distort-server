## Server Overview
### Configuration
The server is configurable by the top-level JSON file `config.json`. It features several configurables:
* `debug`: boolean; print debug-level information to the console iff this key has a positive truthyness value
* `ipfsNode`: object; information on the IPFS node to use for IPFS API and as the node's identity
    * `address`: string; IP or domain address of the IPFS node to use
    * `bootstrap`: array of strings; A list of [IPFS multiaddrs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-addr) to connect to at server start, 
    to help bootstrap connectivity between DistoRt peers
    * `port`: positive integer; API port of the IPFS node to use
* `mongoAddress`: string; the string to use to connect to the MongoDB to use. Eg., "mongodb://mongo:27017/distort"
* `port`: positive integer; the local port to open for REST API calls
* `protocolVersion`: string; the version string of the protocol this server will implement. Eg., "0.1.0"

### Launch Actions
1. Connect to the configured MongoDB to use for node storage. Retry every 5 seconds until successful connection
1. Attempt to successfully perform the following actions without failure. Retry every 5 seconds until completion without having to abort
    1. Connect to the configured IPFS node that will be used as the node's broadcasting identity and gateway
    1. [Force the connected IPFS node to verify pubsub signatures](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/c10f043f3bb7a48e8b43e7f4e35e1cbccf762c68/docs/experimental-features.md#message-signing) 
so that trust of IPFS identities implies trust of the certificates they publish
    1. (Optional) Connect to configured bootstrap IPFS nodes. Failure to connect to bootstrap nodes does not affect success of launch
    1. Determine if there already exists a root account for the given IPFS identity.
        * *If so...* First, determine which local accounts are enabled and have the IPFS identity of the connected node. 
        For each account, subscribe the IPFS node to the pubsub channels they have added
        * *Otherwise...* Create a root account for the in-use IPFS identity. 
        The default password mechanism is to generate a random 128-bit string and convert it to Base64. It is not stored in the database. 
        The PBKDF2 hash of this password is used as the authentication token. It is not stored in the database. 
        The SHA256 hash of this token is stored in the database for later comparison when REST API calls are made using said token. 
        Finally, create a new certificate and save the newly created account and certificate details to the database
    1. Initialize REST paths and launch server on configured port
    
### Runtime Actions
<a name="handle-api-requests"></a>
* **Handle API Requests** - Perform actions specified by the REST requests received on the configured port. Details described below
<a name="dequeue-messages"></a>
* **Dequeue Messages** - Every five minutes, dequeue a message for every enabled account with this IPFS identity on its active group. If a respective account has no active group, then nothing is dequeued for it. 
When dequeuing a message, the server must first generate a random path through the binary group tree (with root `0` and `6` layers, for a total of 63 vertices, numbered breadth first). Then the server must dequeue the 
first message in their queue which is to be sent to a peer whose node in the group intersects the path. If no messages to dequeue have valid recipient for the generated path, or if the message queue is empty, then a 
random message is generated and encrypted to an ephemeral key, then broadcast to all channels on the generated path. If a message does meet the criteria, it is encrypted to the recipient and padded with additional bytes so all 
real and fake messages are of equal size, then broadcast on all channels on the generated path
<a name="receive-messages"></a>
* **Receive Messages** - Ensure message was published with a supported protocol version. Attempt to decrypt the message with all non-expired keys that match the IPFS identity is use. 
If there is a local account whose certificate decrypts the message, store the message under a conversation uniquely identified by the local account, peer account, and group over which the message was sent
<a name="renew-certificates"></a>
* **Renew Certificates** - Every thirty minutes, for every enabled account with this IPFS identity, update its certificate's expiry date to be two weeks from the current time. Then, for each of those account, publish the 
certificate over its active group's certificate channel. If the account does not have an active group, its certificate will not be broadcast. Each certificate broadcast contains a public encryption key, 
a public signing key (not used), the new expiration, and the group nodes the account is currently subscribed to (of which the active account is an element of)
<a name="receive-certificates"></a>
* **Receive Certificates** - Ensure certificate was published with a supported protocol version. If the certificate's public keys are stored locally update the certificate's expiry date and groups. If the certificate is new, 
invalidate any other certificates this peer has published and save the new one

## REST API

### Response Codes
<a name="200"></a>
* **200** - Request was performed successfully
    - This response code is returned if and only if the request was performed without error
<a name="400"></a>
* **400** - Bad Request
    - The client failed to specify required fields
    - ... fields were incorrectly formatted
    - ... gave incorrect parameters for the specified action/request
<a name="401"></a>
* **401** - Unauthorized
    - The client gave an incorrect authentication token
<a name="403"></a>
* **403** - Forbidden
    - The client attempted to view/modify an account it cannot access
    - ... attempted to authorize as an IPFS identity different from that of the connected IPFS node. This is to ensure client knows their broadcasting identity
    - ... attempted to disable the root account
<a name="404"></a>
* **404** - Not Found
    - The client attempted to access a resource that does not exist
    - This can range from deleting a group that does not exist to updating an account which does not exist
    - Enqueuing messages to a peer for whom there is no local certificate will return `404` since the required resource does not yet locally stored
<a name="500"></a>
* **500** - Internal Server Error
    - An internal server error occurred and caused the request to be abandoned prematurely
